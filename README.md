A terminal hangman game made in C++

This program allows you to play hangman with a word that is randomly chosen from a text file you specified. 

# Build program
Simply type "make".

# Launch program
To launch this program, type: "./termihangman [FILE NAME]".

Only letters from the English alphabet are read, so I recommend you use text files containing only English words.

TermiHangman was originally programmed as an exercise, but I found it too fun not to share. I hope you find this as enjoyable as I do.
